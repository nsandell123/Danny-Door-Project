# Danny-Door-Project
My friend, who was wheelchair bound, needed assistance opening his bedroom door independently. I was able to use an IoT-based solution, connecting his communication device and phone to a motor attached to his bedroom door, so that he could use his communication device any wifi-enabled device to open and close the door.
